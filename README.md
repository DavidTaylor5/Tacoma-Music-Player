## App Setup

There are three steps to running the Tacoma Music Player App:

2) Plug in a USB cable into your computer and upload mp3 files to the Music folder on Android device.
3) Accept the "Music and audio" prompt when first opening the app.  

## Overview

**I love listening to music.** My favorite way to listen to music is by using mp3 players. 
This project was a great way for me to work on an app that I would use every day.
This project is inspired by mp3 player apps that I used in the past, such as Musicolet or Samsung Music. 
In fact, I was able to recreate some of my favorite parts of those apps into my own. 
Instead of searching the google play store for the perfect app, I found that I could utilize my android experience
to create my own vision of the perfect mp3 player app. 

## Benefits

I hope that Tacoma Music Player can be another great option for users around the world to pick as their mp3 player.

Specifically, here are some of the benefits of my app:

**Free / AD-free** -> Most music player apps have ads or in app purchases, or upfront costs. I felt these detract from user experience. 

**Navigation is intuitive** -> Swipe left and right to navigate each page. (queue, player, playlists, albums, song list)

**The UI looks great** -> UI is not too cluttered, UI has great contrast as it's mostly black and white. 

**Music available offline** -> As the songs are downloaded to the user's "Music" folder, all songs are available without an internet connection.

**User data is safe** -> The app will not collect user data. 

**Buying mp3 albums is a great way to support artists** -> streaming platforms often pay artists very little per stream.
