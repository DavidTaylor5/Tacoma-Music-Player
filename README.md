# Tacoma-Music-Player
Android mp3 music player app. 
I think that buying music from an artist supports them more than streaming. 
Buying albums also holds artists to a higher standard, rather than streaming one song. To buy
and album means that an artist has a consice album with quality tracks. 

Basic Project Goals:
1) Create a mp3 player for local mp3 files.
2) Use best practices for music player, utilizing media3.
3) Create an intuitive user interface. 
4) List my own app on the Google Play Store.

Project Features [How can my app standout?]
1) I want to be able to collect local music playing statistics. [Similar to Spotify Wrapped]
2) I want users to be able to cut mp3 files, essentially editing the songs. [Only keep the best parts!]
